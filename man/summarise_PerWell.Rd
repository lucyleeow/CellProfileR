\title{Summarise Per well}
\usage{
summarise_perWell(df_full, df_filtered, num_images)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_full}{Dataframe of full raw (per image) Cell Profiler data, with no
images (rows) removed.}

\item{df_filtered}{Optional argument. Dataframe of filtered Cell Profiler 
data, with poor quality images removed. If given, this dataframe will be
used to calculate the median value of features that start with 'Median'.}

\item{num_images}{The number of images taken per well.}
}
\value{
A dataframe or data.table (if filtered = TRUE) with one value per
    well.
}
\description{
Calculate the sum (for 'Count' features) or median (for features starting 
with 'Median' ) value of the Cell Profiler columns (features) for each well. 
If only df_full is given, the sum and median of ALL images (rows) will be 
output. If df_filtered is also provided, the sum of ALL images (i.e. using 
df_full) will be output for 'Count' features but the median of only the 
images remaining after filtering (i.e. using df_filtered) will be output for
features starting with 'Median'.
